### MEMORANDUM  
**Date**: October 26, 2024  
**Subject**: Navigating the Energy Transition: Key Trends and Implications for MARA

---

### Executive Summary  

The energy sector is undergoing a dramatic transformation driven by the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy and meet the rapidly rising power demand from data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and the “knowledge age”. This memo analyzes key market trends and strategic shifts observed in recent years, with a particular focus on implications for MARA, a Bitcoin mining company.

1. **The Rise of Data Centers and the Quest for Reliable Power**  
The AI revolution is creating unprecedented power demand. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are investing heavily in data centers to support their cloud services and AI initiatives, resulting in a surge in electricity consumption. Goldman Sachs predicts data center power consumption in the lower 48 states to increase to 266 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2035, with the potential to reach almost 600 TWh under a rapid technology commercialization scenario.<sup>[1]</sup> Notably, the power intensity of AI workloads is more than seven times higher than that of traditional workloads.<sup>[2]</sup>

These hyperscalers are seeking reliable and sustainable power solutions. While they are exploring nuclear and geothermal for long-term decarbonization, those options face significant timelines (10+ years for nuclear due to regulatory hurdles) and geographical constraints. In the meantime, the immediate need for firm, 24/7 power is leading them to rely primarily on natural gas. Dominion Energy in Virginia, a major data center hub, is already expanding its gas capacity to meet this demand.<sup>[3]</sup>

2. **The Resurgence of Nuclear Power**  
After decades of decline, nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global nuclear capacity will need to triple by 2050 to meet climate goals.<sup>[4]</sup> Recent developments highlight this shift:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) acquired a data center campus directly powered by a 2.5-gigawatt (GW) nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.<sup>[5]</sup>  
- Microsoft secured a $1.5 billion loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to power its data centers.<sup>[6]</sup>  
- The Biden Administration and a coalition of 20+ countries committed to tripling nuclear capacity by 2050.<sup>[7]</sup>  

While large-scale reactors are ideal for grid electricity, small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a promising solution for behind-the-meter applications and decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Microsoft and Oracle are both investing in SMRs, reflecting the potential of this technology.<sup>[8]</sup> However, regulatory hurdles and the need for a skilled workforce remain challenges for widespread nuclear deployment.

3. **The Importance of Natural Gas in the Transition**  
Natural gas is playing a critical role in the energy transition. As cleaner than coal, it is increasingly used to balance out the intermittency of renewables. EQT Corporation, the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., curtailed 1 billion cubic feet per day of production in response to warm weather and elevated storage levels.<sup>[9]</sup> However, the surge in gas-fired power plant capacity is a strong indicator of its importance in meeting future power needs.

Enverus Intelligence Research predicts a maximum increase in U.S. gas burn of under 13 billion cubic feet per day by 2035, driven by data center expansion.<sup>[10]</sup> Hubs like Florida Gas Zone 3, Transco Zone 5, and Henry Hub are expected to see significant incremental demand.<sup>[11]</sup> The continued growth of the LNG market further underscores the importance of natural gas in the global energy mix.

4. **CCUS as a Profitable Decarbonization Solution**  
Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) has gone from a hype-driven solution to facing the “trough of disillusionment” as investors realize the challenges in permitting, pore space availability, and carbon pricing.<sup>[12]</sup> Nevertheless, Enverus Intelligence Research highlights several viable commercialization strategies:

- Large hub-scale projects to cut transportation and storage costs by up to 8 times.
- Credit and technology stacking, such as using Class II wells for faster permitting and bio-capture solutions (BECCS and BiCRS) for lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
- Conventional CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for higher returns.

Notably, Gevo’s acquisition of Red Trail Energy for $210 million,<sup>[13]</sup> a company with operational carbon capture, illustrates the market’s recognition of the potential value in CCUS projects.

5. **The Continued Growth of Renewables**  
Despite challenges, renewables remain a dominant force. Enverus Intelligence Research projects a 203% increase in total installed capacity in the lower 48 states by 2050, with renewable capacity growing from 31% to 63%.<sup>[14]</sup> However, the intermittency of renewables presents challenges for grid stability.

- California, a leader in renewables, has observed surplus generation during peak conditions, necessitating curtailment of solar supply.<sup>[15]</sup>  
- Texas is experiencing a different challenge, with electricity demand exceeding supply during peak hours, leading to rolling blackouts.<sup>[16]</sup>  

These contrasting dynamics underscore the need for grid modernization, increased investment in energy storage, and a shift towards dispatchable generation sources like natural gas and nuclear to ensure reliability as renewables penetrate further.

### Implications for MARA  

As a Bitcoin miner, MARA’s operations are energy-intensive, making it essential for the company to secure reliable and cost-effective power sources. Given the current trends in the energy sector, MARA should consider the following:

- **Partnerships with Power Producers**: Strategic alliances with gas-fired power plant operators in data center hubs can provide access to firm, 24/7 power at competitive rates, potentially leveraging excess capacity during off-peak hours. MARA could also explore joint ventures to develop behind-the-meter gas-fired generation to ensure energy security and mitigate price volatility.

- **Strategic Location of Mining Operations**: Markets like SPP, which ranks high in terms of robust forward power prices, low feedstock costs, and expected price volatility,<sup>[17]</sup> could be attractive locations for MARA’s mining farms.

`# Memo 2

**To**: MARA Management  
**From**: Minjae AI (MinjaeAI@mara.com)    
**Date**: October 28, 2024  
**Subject**: Bitcoin Mining Market Update and Strategic Implications for MARA

---

### Executive Summary  

The Bitcoin mining landscape experienced significant shifts in the latter half of 2024. The April 2024 halving, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin price and hashprice, squeezing miners' profitability. However, the market demonstrated resilience, with Bitcoin price recovering to ~$67,275 and hashprice showing an uptrend, reaching a peak of ~$53.97 per PH/s/Day over a weekend in October.

This memo analyzes key market trends, including hashprice fluctuations, network hashrate dynamics, and the emergence of hashrate derivatives. It further delves into the strategic focus of industry leaders and outlines potential opportunities and implications for MARA.

### Hashprice Volatility & Network Hashrate Growth  

The post-halving period saw a challenging hashprice environment for Bitcoin miners. In September 2024, both USD and BTC-denominated monthly average hashprices hit a post-2017 low.

- Average USD hashprice fell by 2.7% month-over-month to $42.37 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  
- Average BTC hashprice fell by 2.8% month-over-month to 0.00070408 BTC per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  

This decline was attributed to factors like the Bitcoin halving, macroeconomic uncertainty, and a surge in network hashrate fueled by next-generation ASICs. However, a late September price rebound in Bitcoin, coupled with a decrease in network difficulty and a slight uptick in transaction fees, contributed to a partial hashprice recovery, closing the month at $46.26 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>

Despite hashprice volatility, the network hashrate continued its upward trajectory, hitting an all-time high of 732 EH/s by October 21, 2024.<sup>2</sup> This growth underscores the industry's commitment to network security and long-term belief in Bitcoin's value proposition.

### The Rise of Hashrate Derivatives  

Luxor, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, introduced innovative financing and risk management tools to the market. Luxor’s Deliverable Hashrate Forwards allow miners to sell future hashrate production for upfront capital. This mechanism provides miners with alternative financing options, reducing reliance on traditional debt financing or equity issuance.

Luxor also reported a thriving hashrate forward market, with private miners actively utilizing these instruments for hedging and financing. Notably, miners who hedged early in 2024 outperformed those who did not, demonstrating the effectiveness of hashrate derivatives in mitigating risk.<sup>1</sup>

### Focus and Shifts in Industry Leaders' Strategy  

Major Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Hut 8, Bitfarms, and CleanSpark have focused on strategic expansion and operational efficiency.

- Riot and Bitfarms reached a settlement, likely involving consolidation or collaboration, suggesting a move towards industry consolidation.<sup>3</sup>  
- Hut 8 expanded its partnership with BITMAIN, focusing on deploying next-generation miners to enhance operational efficiency.<sup>3</sup>  
- CleanSpark ended its colocation with Coinmint, aiming to cut operational costs and increase profitability.<sup>4</sup>  
- TeraWulf is actively seeking to expand its HPC/AI and Bitcoin mining operations.<sup>4</sup>  

MARA secured a $200 million credit line with Bitcoin collateral, signifying an increased focus on leveraging digital assets for financial flexibility.<sup>2</sup>

### Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Given the trends outlined above, MARA’s executive team should consider the following:

- **Hashrate Derivatives**: Explore the strategic use of hashrate derivatives to hedge against hashprice volatility and secure more predictable cash flows. Given Luxor's data on miners who hedged early outperforming spot miners, a hedging strategy could be critical to maintaining MARA's profitability in the volatile mining landscape.

- **Strategic Partnerships**: Consider forming strategic partnerships, similar to Hut 8's initiative, with ASIC manufacturers like BITMAIN to gain preferential access to next-generation miners. This would not only enhance MARA's operational efficiency but also potentially provide a competitive advantage in securing the latest hardware.

The significant 48% surge in freight revenue year-over-year highlights the strength of the combined network, capturing new traffic and benefiting from the expanded market reach. The solid 30% growth in both operating income and net income reflects the company’s operational efficiencies and ability to leverage synergies from the merger. Diluted EPS also saw a 30% year-over-year increase, demonstrating value creation for shareholders.

Examining the details of the financial performance, the robust revenue growth is attributed to a combination of volume increases and favorable pricing across various business segments. The Intermodal and Automotive segments experienced the highest revenue increases. Operating ratio, a key metric of railway efficiency, improved to 57.2% in Q2 2024 from 61.7% in Q2 2023, indicating cost discipline and effective resource allocation.

# Recent Developments

Recent developments in CPKC's corporate actions and strategic decisions further illuminate its commitment to growth and shareholder value:

- **Board Appointment**: The appointment of Arturo Gutiérrez Hernández to the Board of Directors in September 2024 is a strategic move to strengthen CPKC's presence in the Mexican market. Mr. Gutiérrez, the CEO of Arca Continental, the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America, brings extensive experience in the region. This appointment is aligned with CPKC's focus on capitalizing on the Mexican market, particularly after establishing the first direct rail link between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico City.<sup>2</sup>

- **Dividend Declaration**: CPKC's declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on October 28, 2024, demonstrates their ongoing commitment to shareholder value. This consistent dividend policy reflects confidence in their financial performance and the future prospects of the merged entity. The dividend is designated as "eligible" under the Income Tax Act (Canada), providing a tax advantage to Canadian shareholders.<sup>3</sup>

- **Executive Departure**: The departure of John Orr, Executive Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer, to join Norfolk Southern as their Chief Operating Officer, initially raised concerns about potential loss of expertise and impact on integration efforts. However, the Corporation proactively addressed these concerns through a strategic agreement with Norfolk Southern.<sup>4</sup>

- **Agreement with Norfolk Southern**: The agreement, reached in March 2024, showcases CPKC's strategic acumen in mitigating risks and maximizing opportunities. The $25 million waiver fee received from Norfolk Southern compensates for releasing Mr. Orr from his non-competition agreement. More importantly, the operational and commercial considerations concerning the Meridian Speedway and Meridian Terminal provide tangible benefits to CPKC. This agreement ensures continued access to crucial infrastructure, strengthening their competitive edge in the southeastern U.S. and increasing the value proposition of their proposed acquisition of the Meridian & Bigbee Railroad (MNBR). The no-hire and non-solicitation agreements for key CPKC employees further protect their intellectual capital and continuity of operations.<sup>5</sup>

# Strategic Focus

CPKC's strategic priorities revolve around maximizing the potential of the combined entity. Their primary focus is on achieving seamless integration of CP and KCS operations, optimizing network efficiency and fluidity. They aim to leverage their expanded network to create new service offerings, attracting new business and strengthening existing customer relationships. Key aspects of their strategic focus include:

- **Integration & Optimization**: CPKC is actively streamlining operations, harmonizing systems, and leveraging best practices from both legacy companies. This includes rationalizing assets, optimizing train schedules, and improving crew utilization. The goal is to achieve a unified, efficient, and reliable network that maximizes capacity and minimizes costs.

- **Growth & Expansion**: CPKC aims to capture new market share by offering competitive transportation solutions and extending its reach to previously underserved areas. They are actively pursuing organic growth through new service offerings and exploring strategic acquisitions to expand their footprint further. The proposed MNBR acquisition, for example, aligns with this strategy, enhancing CPKC's network in the Gulf Coast region.

- **Technology & Innovation**: CPKC is leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and customer service. They are investing in advanced train control systems, data analytics, and digital tools to optimize operations, improve safety performance, and provide real-time shipment visibility to customers.

# Opportunities for MARA

CPKC’s strategic focus on operational efficiency, growth, and technological advancement presents attractive opportunities for MARA to explore synergistic partnerships:

- **Potential for Energy Collaboration**: MARA, as a leading Bitcoin miner, can leverage its expertise in energy solutions to offer competitive and sustainable energy supply options to CPKC. This could involve direct energy supply agreements for CPKC’s operations, potentially utilizing renewable energy sources to align with their sustainability goals. Joint ventures in developing renewable energy projects, such as solar or wind farms, near CPKC’s rail lines, could also be explored.

- **Data Center Opportunities**: CPKC’s expansive network and land assets across North America provide MARA with a unique opportunity to strategically locate new data centers near renewable energy sources. The proximity to CPKC’s rail lines would ensure reliable access to electricity and facilitate the transportation of critical equipment for data center construction and maintenance.

These potential collaborations could benefit both companies, with MARA gaining access to essential infrastructure and logistical advantages, while CPKC could secure reliable and potentially cost-effective energy solutions and optimize land asset utilization.
