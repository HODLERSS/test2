### MEMORANDUM  
**Date**: October 26, 2024  
**Subject**: Navigating the Energy Transition: Key Trends and Implications for MARA

---

### Executive Summary  

The energy sector is undergoing a dramatic transformation driven by the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy and meet the rapidly rising power demand from data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and the “knowledge age”. This memo analyzes key market trends and strategic shifts observed in recent years, with a particular focus on implications for MARA, a Bitcoin mining company.

1. **The Rise of Data Centers and the Quest for Reliable Power**  
The AI revolution is creating unprecedented power demand. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are investing heavily in data centers to support their cloud services and AI initiatives, resulting in a surge in electricity consumption. Goldman Sachs predicts data center power consumption in the lower 48 states to increase to 266 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2035, with the potential to reach almost 600 TWh under a rapid technology commercialization scenario.<sup>[1]</sup> Notably, the power intensity of AI workloads is more than seven times higher than that of traditional workloads.<sup>[2]</sup>

These hyperscalers are seeking reliable and sustainable power solutions. While they are exploring nuclear and geothermal for long-term decarbonization, those options face significant timelines (10+ years for nuclear due to regulatory hurdles) and geographical constraints. In the meantime, the immediate need for firm, 24/7 power is leading them to rely primarily on natural gas. Dominion Energy in Virginia, a major data center hub, is already expanding its gas capacity to meet this demand.<sup>[3]</sup>

2. **The Resurgence of Nuclear Power**  
After decades of decline, nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global nuclear capacity will need to triple by 2050 to meet climate goals.<sup>[4]</sup> Recent developments highlight this shift:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) acquired a data center campus directly powered by a 2.5-gigawatt (GW) nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.<sup>[5]</sup>  
- Microsoft secured a $1.5 billion loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to power its data centers.<sup>[6]</sup>  
- The Biden Administration and a coalition of 20+ countries committed to tripling nuclear capacity by 2050.<sup>[7]</sup>  

While large-scale reactors are ideal for grid electricity, small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a promising solution for behind-the-meter applications and decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Microsoft and Oracle are both investing in SMRs, reflecting the potential of this technology.<sup>[8]</sup> However, regulatory hurdles and the need for a skilled workforce remain challenges for widespread nuclear deployment.

3. **The Importance of Natural Gas in the Transition**  
Natural gas is playing a critical role in the energy transition. As cleaner than coal, it is increasingly used to balance out the intermittency of renewables. EQT Corporation, the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., curtailed 1 billion cubic feet per day of production in response to warm weather and elevated storage levels.<sup>[9]</sup> However, the surge in gas-fired power plant capacity is a strong indicator of its importance in meeting future power needs.

Enverus Intelligence Research predicts a maximum increase in U.S. gas burn of under 13 billion cubic feet per day by 2035, driven by data center expansion.<sup>[10]</sup> Hubs like Florida Gas Zone 3, Transco Zone 5, and Henry Hub are expected to see significant incremental demand.<sup>[11]</sup> The continued growth of the LNG market further underscores the importance of natural gas in the global energy mix.

4. **CCUS as a Profitable Decarbonization Solution**  
Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) has gone from a hype-driven solution to facing the “trough of disillusionment” as investors realize the challenges in permitting, pore space availability, and carbon pricing.<sup>[12]</sup> Nevertheless, Enverus Intelligence Research highlights several viable commercialization strategies:

- Large hub-scale projects to cut transportation and storage costs by up to 8 times.
- Credit and technology stacking, such as using Class II wells for faster permitting and bio-capture solutions (BECCS and BiCRS) for lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
- Conventional CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for higher returns.

Notably, Gevo’s acquisition of Red Trail Energy for $210 million,<sup>[13]</sup> a company with operational carbon capture, illustrates the market’s recognition of the potential value in CCUS projects.

5. **The Continued Growth of Renewables**  
Despite challenges, renewables remain a dominant force. Enverus Intelligence Research projects a 203% increase in total installed capacity in the lower 48 states by 2050, with renewable capacity growing from 31% to 63%.<sup>[14]</sup> However, the intermittency of renewables presents challenges for grid stability.

- California, a leader in renewables, has observed surplus generation during peak conditions, necessitating curtailment of solar supply.<sup>[15]</sup>  
- Texas is experiencing a different challenge, with electricity demand exceeding supply during peak hours, leading to rolling blackouts.<sup>[16]</sup>  

These contrasting dynamics underscore the need for grid modernization, increased investment in energy storage, and a shift towards dispatchable generation sources like natural gas and nuclear to ensure reliability as renewables penetrate further.

### Implications for MARA  

As a Bitcoin miner, MARA’s operations are energy-intensive, making it essential for the company to secure reliable and cost-effective power sources. Given the current trends in the energy sector, MARA should consider the following:

- **Partnerships with Power Producers**: Strategic alliances with gas-fired power plant operators in data center hubs can provide access to firm, 24/7 power at competitive rates, potentially leveraging excess capacity during off-peak hours. MARA could also explore joint ventures to develop behind-the-meter gas-fired generation to ensure energy security and mitigate price volatility.

- **Strategic Location of Mining Operations**: Markets like SPP, which ranks high in terms of robust forward power prices, low feedstock costs, and expected price volatility,<sup>[17]</sup> could be attractive locations for MARA’s mining farms.

### Executive Summary  

The Bitcoin mining landscape experienced significant shifts in the latter half of 2024. The April 2024 halving, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin price and hashprice, squeezing miners' profitability. However, the market demonstrated resilience, with Bitcoin price recovering to ~$67,275 and hashprice showing an uptrend, reaching a peak of ~$53.97 per PH/s/Day over a weekend in October.

This memo analyzes key market trends, including hashprice fluctuations, network hashrate dynamics, and the emergence of hashrate derivatives. It further delves into the strategic focus of industry leaders and outlines potential opportunities and implications for MARA.

### Hashprice Volatility & Network Hashrate Growth  

The post-halving period saw a challenging hashprice environment for Bitcoin miners. In September 2024, both USD and BTC-denominated monthly average hashprices hit a post-2017 low.

- Average USD hashprice fell by 2.7% month-over-month to $42.37 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  
- Average BTC hashprice fell by 2.8% month-over-month to 0.00070408 BTC per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  

This decline was attributed to factors like the Bitcoin halving, macroeconomic uncertainty, and a surge in network hashrate fueled by next-generation ASICs. However, a late September price rebound in Bitcoin, coupled with a decrease in network difficulty and a slight uptick in transaction fees, contributed to a partial hashprice recovery, closing the month at $46.26 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>

Despite hashprice volatility, the network hashrate continued its upward trajectory, hitting an all-time high of 732 EH/s by October 21, 2024.<sup>2</sup> This growth underscores the industry's commitment to network security and long-term belief in Bitcoin's value proposition.

### The Rise of Hashrate Derivatives  

Luxor, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, introduced innovative financing and risk management tools to the market. Luxor’s Deliverable Hashrate Forwards allow miners to sell future hashrate production for upfront capital. This mechanism provides miners with alternative financing options, reducing reliance on traditional debt financing or equity issuance.

Luxor also reported a thriving hashrate forward market, with private miners actively utilizing these instruments for hedging and financing. Notably, miners who hedged early in 2024 outperformed those who did not, demonstrating the effectiveness of hashrate derivatives in mitigating risk.<sup>1</sup>

### Focus and Shifts in Industry Leaders' Strategy  

Major Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Hut 8, Bitfarms, and CleanSpark have focused on strategic expansion and operational efficiency.

- Riot and Bitfarms reached a settlement, likely involving consolidation or collaboration, suggesting a move towards industry consolidation.<sup>3</sup>  
- Hut 8 expanded its partnership with BITMAIN, focusing on deploying next-generation miners to enhance operational efficiency.<sup>3</sup>  
- CleanSpark ended its colocation with Coinmint, aiming to cut operational costs and increase profitability.<sup>4</sup>  
- TeraWulf is actively seeking to expand its HPC/AI and Bitcoin mining operations.<sup>4</sup>  

MARA secured a $200 million credit line with Bitcoin collateral, signifying an increased focus on leveraging digital assets for financial flexibility.<sup>2</sup>

### Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Given the trends outlined above, MARA’s executive team should consider the following:

- **Hashrate Derivatives**: Explore the strategic use of hashrate derivatives to hedge against hashprice volatility and secure more predictable cash flows. Given Luxor's data on miners who hedged early outperforming spot miners, a hedging strategy could be critical to maintaining MARA's profitability in the volatile mining landscape.

- **Strategic Partnerships**: Consider forming strategic partnerships, similar to Hut 8's initiative, with ASIC manufacturers like BITMAIN to gain preferential access to next-generation miners. This would not only enhance MARA's operational efficiency but also potentially provide a competitive advantage in securing the latest hardware.

## Recent Focus and Strategic Shifts  

- **Acquisition of Block Mining, Inc.**: RIOT acquired Block Mining, a Kentucky-based Bitcoin miner, in July 2024 for $92.5 million ($18.5 million cash and $74 million RIOT stock).² This acquisition brings 60 MW of capacity, with potential expansion to over 300MW in Kentucky across three sites and an immediate increase of 1EH/s to RIOT’s hash rate. The acquisition aligns with RIOT's strategy of geographic diversification and strengthens relationships with power companies in the MISO region.³

- **ATM Offerings**: RIOT initiated several at-the-market offerings in 2023 and 2024, including a $750 million offering in August 2024. RIOT has been actively utilizing these offerings to raise capital, as evidenced by the ~$793 million in net proceeds raised through October 28, 2024.⁴

- **Hash Rate Growth Guidance Revision**: RIOT lowered its hash rate guidance for 2024 and 2025. The 2024 target is now 34.9 EH/s (down from 36.3 EH/s) and the 2025 target is 46.7 EH/s (down from 56.6 EH/s). The Kentucky expansion, originally slated for 2025, is pushed to 2026 and 2027 due to permitting delays. Additionally, substation development at the Corsicana Facility is delayed, impacting the anticipated timeline for building completion.⁵

- **Settlement Agreement with Bitfarms**: RIOT, which previously held a 14.9% stake in Bitfarms Ltd. and sought a merger, reached a settlement agreement with the company in September 2024.⁶ This included board changes and Riot withdrawing its requisition for a special shareholder meeting. Riot also withdrew its acquisition proposal.⁷

---

## Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

RIOT's revised hash rate growth strategy presents an opportunity for MARA to capitalize on the potential slowdown in RIOT's expansion. MARA executives should closely monitor RIOT’s progress in Kentucky and at the Corsicana facility, identifying potential advantages in securing resources or acquiring talent. The slower expansion of RIOT might ease competition for skilled labor, specialized equipment, and favorable energy contracts. MARA could explore opportunities to attract experienced personnel from RIOT or collaborate on infrastructure development in strategically advantageous locations.

Additionally, RIOT's focus on the U.S. market, especially Texas, could create opportunities for MARA to focus on international expansion. RIOT's withdrawal of its bid for Bitfarms suggests a potential decreased interest in acquiring international assets, creating a space for MARA to pursue acquisitions or partnerships in emerging markets with favorable regulatory environments and energy prices.

## 3. Recent Focus and Strategic Shifts  

Caterpillar experienced a 4% year-over-year decline in sales and revenues in 3Q 2024, primarily driven by lower sales volume. While dealer inventories increased, the growth was less than in 3Q 2023. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating profit margin remained strong at 20%, driven in part by pricing discipline and other factors across several key industry segments. The company's Energy & Transportation segment saw sales increase due to higher demand in data center power applications and turbines. Conversely, sales decreased in the Construction and Resource Industries segments primarily due to changes in dealer inventories.

Caterpillar continues to execute its strategy for long-term profitable growth, deploying significant capital to return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. The company announced an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend in June 2024 and added $20 billion to its share repurchase authorization.² Additionally, Caterpillar appointed Nazzic Keene, former CEO of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), to its board of directors in October 2024, bringing valuable technology experience.³ Further information about management focus can be found in their latest reports and the June and August earnings calls available on their investor relations website.⁴

In August 2024, Caterpillar secured a new 364-day credit facility for $3.15 billion.⁵ This replaced the prior 364-day facility and is expected to provide further financial flexibility.

Caterpillar's growing presence in data center power generation could lead to collaborations for MARA to secure reliable and efficient energy solutions, thereby optimizing mining operations. Given Caterpillar's commitment to a reduced-carbon future, exploration of sustainable power sources, including renewables, would be strategically beneficial for MARA's environmental impact and long-term cost structure.

Furthermore, Caterpillar's financial strength and its commitment to returning capital to shareholders suggest stability and growth potential, which can be beneficial for MARA when considering potential strategic partnerships. Caterpillar's focus on technological innovation, further underscored by Keene's appointment to the board, could also offer synergistic opportunities in areas such as energy optimization and operational efficiency for MARA's Bitcoin mining operations.

## 1. Executive Summary  

MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) is a Nasdaq-listed company primarily focused on two distinct businesses: (1) enterprise analytics software and (2) bitcoin acquisition and holding. The company holds a substantial amount of bitcoin, positioning itself as a "Bitcoin Treasury Company." As of September 30, 2024, MicroStrategy held approximately 252,220 bitcoins, acquired at an average price of $39,266 per bitcoin. Its enterprise analytics software business generated $116.1 million in revenue in Q3 2024. MicroStrategy’s aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy has significantly impacted its financials, including substantial digital asset impairment losses. The company has recently announced an ambitious capital raising plan to further expand its bitcoin holdings.

## 2. Financial Performance  

MicroStrategy’s financial performance reflects its dual business model. While the software business generates recurring revenue, the bitcoin holdings expose the company to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.

## 3. Strategic Shift & Operational Focus  

MicroStrategy continues its aggressive pursuit of bitcoin acquisition, financing these purchases with a combination of equity and debt offerings. The company maintains that bitcoin is a superior treasury reserve asset and expects its BTC Yield to improve shareholder value over the long term.

The company recently unveiled its "21/21 Plan," aiming to raise $42 billion over the next three years—$21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. This substantial capital raise signals the company's doubled-down commitment to expanding its bitcoin holdings. As a tangible step towards this plan, the company filed a new $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering on October 30, 2024.³ This follows recent debt offerings, including the $1.01 billion issuance of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 in September 2024.⁴ MicroStrategy used a portion of the proceeds from the convertible notes to redeem the higher interest bearing $500 million 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2028.⁵

## 4. Strategic Shift & Operational Focus

Operationally, MicroStrategy continues to invest in its enterprise analytics software business. While bitcoin activities dominate headlines, the software segment remains a key revenue generator. In Q3 2024, subscription services revenue grew 32.5% year-over-year, indicating continued traction in the cloud subscription model. However, total revenues declined 10.3% year-over-year due to decreased product license and product support revenue.

The company has revised its BTC Yield target to an annual rate of 6% to 10% for 2025 through 2027, reflecting both its past performance and ambitions for future bitcoin accumulation relative to changes in its outstanding shares.⁶

## 5. Opportunities and Implications for MARA Executives  

MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to bitcoin, coupled with its substantial holdings, creates several potential opportunities and implications for MARA, a bitcoin miner. MicroStrategy’s large and frequent acquisitions of bitcoin represent significant demand for newly mined bitcoin and could provide price support that benefits miners like MARA. However, MicroStrategy's use of debt to finance acquisitions and the volatility of bitcoin prices pose risks to the company’s financial stability, potentially creating market instability that also negatively impacts miners.

Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s ability to continue raising large amounts of capital may provide additional insight regarding investor appetite for bitcoin exposure and may also signal future large purchases that could temporarily drive up bitcoin prices. Conversely, if MicroStrategy experiences difficulties in raising capital or encounters financial distress due to bitcoin price fluctuations, it could trigger a sell-off that negatively impacts the bitcoin market and, consequently, MARA’s profitability.

## 6. Fun Facts  

- MicroStrategy holds more bitcoin than any other public company.
- Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, is a vocal bitcoin advocate.
- The company’s software is used by many Fortune 500 companies.`,

## Potential Opportunities and Implications for MARA Executives  

Meta’s aggressive push into AI and the metaverse represents both an opportunity and a challenge for MARA. Meta's significant capital expenditures to build AI infrastructure and its projection of continued increases in 2025 are particularly relevant. This signals a large increase in demand for specialized hardware, potentially creating a strong market for MARA's Bitcoin mining ASICs. Meta's focus on AI-powered glasses could also present opportunities for collaborations in hardware development or integration of blockchain technology for secure data management within AR/VR environments.

However, Meta's entry into the AI hardware market could also create significant competition. MARA executives need to closely monitor Meta's AI strategy and hardware development to understand the competitive landscape and identify areas for differentiation or collaboration. The company's foray into AR/VR with Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses is another development to watch, as this will impact future infrastructure development for related technologies, particularly the metaverse.

However, the company's Q4 2024 financials showed a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to significant investments in property and equipment and acquisitions.<sup>2</sup> This investment trend continued in Q1 2025, albeit with a smaller net reduction in cash.

## Strategic Focus and Shifts  

Microsoft's recent strategic focus has been on AI integration. Satya Nadella, CEO, stated, "AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role.”<sup>1</sup> This emphasis on AI is evident in the development of Microsoft Copilot and its integration into various products and services. Microsoft is actively pursuing an "AI-first" strategy aiming to integrate AI capabilities across its product portfolio.

In January 2024, Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision, which significantly expanded its gaming portfolio.<sup>3</sup> This acquisition has been a key driver of growth in the gaming sector, as noted in subsequent earnings releases.

Microsoft has restructured its segments for FY25 to align with its internal management and monitoring.<sup>4</sup> Most notably, revenue from commercial components of Microsoft 365 is consolidated within the Productivity and Business Processes segment. This shift underscores the company's prioritization of its Microsoft 365 offerings. The company has also made several other segment changes, including moving Copilot Pro revenue to the Search and news advertising segment and combining Windows and Devices revenue reporting. These changes suggest a more integrated approach to product development and go-to-market strategy.

Microsoft addressed a significant cybersecurity incident in January 2024, termed the "Midnight Blizzard" attack, revealing the vulnerabilities of its legacy systems.<sup>3</sup> This prompted the company to prioritize security enhancements even at the risk of disrupting existing business processes, signifying a tangible shift in their risk calculus.

## Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Microsoft's aggressive pursuit of AI, including development of specialized hardware for AI workloads, could create potential opportunities for MARA. As a bitcoin miner, MARA possesses expertise in specialized hardware and high-performance computing infrastructure. Microsoft’s increasing need for such infrastructure, both for its own operations and its cloud services, presents a potential avenue for collaboration. MARA could explore providing computing power for Microsoft's AI endeavors or collaborating on hardware development optimized for both AI and Bitcoin mining.

Furthermore, Microsoft's focus on responsible AI development and the creation of secure, trusted platforms for AI applications can be leveraged by MARA to address concerns about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining. By integrating with Microsoft’s sustainable cloud infrastructure and adopting their responsible AI principles, MARA could bolster its ESG profile and potentially attract institutional investors.

## Recent Strategic Focus and Shifts  

Coinbase’s Q3 2024 shareholder letter outlined three priorities for 2024: driving revenue, crypto utility, and regulatory clarity.³  

- **Revenue**: Coinbase is focused on expanding its primary revenue streams (trading, staking, USDC integration, custody, and subscriptions) through international growth and product development initiatives such as derivatives and Coinbase One.

- **Crypto Utility**: The company aims to reduce transaction friction and expand crypto’s use cases. Key initiatives include integrating stablecoins across product offerings, expanding the Base network (which became the #1 L2 in transactions and total value locked in Q3 2024), and launching cbBTC to facilitate Bitcoin’s use in decentralized finance.⁴

- **Regulatory Clarity**: Coinbase continues to advocate for clear crypto regulations, particularly in the US. The company actively engages with policymakers and supports organizations like Fairshake and StandWithCrypto, leveraging the influence of the growing crypto owner voting bloc.⁵  

In Q3 2024, Coinbase’s board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, reflecting confidence in the company's long-term prospects and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.⁶ Other notable developments include integrating EURC, launching Basenames for user-friendly crypto addresses, and appointing three new directors to the board: Christa Davies, Paul Clement, and Chris Lehane, with Ms. Davies and Mr. Clement serving on the Audit and Compliance Committee.⁷ Kathryn Haun did not stand for re-election to the Board in Q2 2024.⁸

## Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Coinbase's strategic focus on enhancing crypto utility through initiatives like Base and cbBTC presents potential partnership opportunities for MARA. MARA could explore integrating its mining operations with Base, leveraging the L2's efficiency and lower transaction fees. This could enhance MARA's profitability by reducing operational costs associated with Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, MARA could collaborate with Coinbase on developing financial products that utilize cbBTC, potentially expanding MARA's reach into the decentralized finance ecosystem and diversifying its revenue streams. Coinbase's ongoing advocacy for regulatory clarity could indirectly benefit MARA by fostering a more stable and predictable operating environment for Bitcoin mining in the US.

Coinbase's $1 billion share buyback announcement signals strong belief in their future trajectory, potentially attracting more institutional investors, enhancing market confidence in crypto more broadly, and thereby creating a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin, which would directly benefit MARA’s operations. Further, Coinbase’s focus on stablecoin and blockchain reward revenue highlights the continued growth in less volatile segments of the crypto market, suggesting that investor interest in crypto is broadening beyond speculative trading, which we view as a positive, long-term indicator for the Bitcoin mining industry.
