### MEMORANDUM  
**Date**: October 26, 2024  
**Subject**: Navigating the Energy Transition: Key Trends and Implications for MARA

---

### Executive Summary  

The energy sector is undergoing a dramatic transformation driven by the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy and meet the rapidly rising power demand from data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and the “knowledge age”. This memo analyzes key market trends and strategic shifts observed in recent years, with a particular focus on implications for MARA, a Bitcoin mining company.

1. **The Rise of Data Centers and the Quest for Reliable Power**  
The AI revolution is creating unprecedented power demand. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are investing heavily in data centers to support their cloud services and AI initiatives, resulting in a surge in electricity consumption. Goldman Sachs predicts data center power consumption in the lower 48 states to increase to 266 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2035, with the potential to reach almost 600 TWh under a rapid technology commercialization scenario.<sup>[1]</sup> Notably, the power intensity of AI workloads is more than seven times higher than that of traditional workloads.<sup>[2]</sup>

These hyperscalers are seeking reliable and sustainable power solutions. While they are exploring nuclear and geothermal for long-term decarbonization, those options face significant timelines (10+ years for nuclear due to regulatory hurdles) and geographical constraints. In the meantime, the immediate need for firm, 24/7 power is leading them to rely primarily on natural gas. Dominion Energy in Virginia, a major data center hub, is already expanding its gas capacity to meet this demand.<sup>[3]</sup>

2. **The Resurgence of Nuclear Power**  
After decades of decline, nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global nuclear capacity will need to triple by 2050 to meet climate goals.<sup>[4]</sup> Recent developments highlight this shift:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) acquired a data center campus directly powered by a 2.5-gigawatt (GW) nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.<sup>[5]</sup>  
- Microsoft secured a $1.5 billion loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan to power its data centers.<sup>[6]</sup>  
- The Biden Administration and a coalition of 20+ countries committed to tripling nuclear capacity by 2050.<sup>[7]</sup>  

While large-scale reactors are ideal for grid electricity, small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a promising solution for behind-the-meter applications and decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Microsoft and Oracle are both investing in SMRs, reflecting the potential of this technology.<sup>[8]</sup> However, regulatory hurdles and the need for a skilled workforce remain challenges for widespread nuclear deployment.

3. **The Importance of Natural Gas in the Transition**  
Natural gas is playing a critical role in the energy transition. As cleaner than coal, it is increasingly used to balance out the intermittency of renewables. EQT Corporation, the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., curtailed 1 billion cubic feet per day of production in response to warm weather and elevated storage levels.<sup>[9]</sup> However, the surge in gas-fired power plant capacity is a strong indicator of its importance in meeting future power needs.

Enverus Intelligence Research predicts a maximum increase in U.S. gas burn of under 13 billion cubic feet per day by 2035, driven by data center expansion.<sup>[10]</sup> Hubs like Florida Gas Zone 3, Transco Zone 5, and Henry Hub are expected to see significant incremental demand.<sup>[11]</sup> The continued growth of the LNG market further underscores the importance of natural gas in the global energy mix.

4. **CCUS as a Profitable Decarbonization Solution**  
Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) has gone from a hype-driven solution to facing the “trough of disillusionment” as investors realize the challenges in permitting, pore space availability, and carbon pricing.<sup>[12]</sup> Nevertheless, Enverus Intelligence Research highlights several viable commercialization strategies:

- Large hub-scale projects to cut transportation and storage costs by up to 8 times.
- Credit and technology stacking, such as using Class II wells for faster permitting and bio-capture solutions (BECCS and BiCRS) for lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
- Conventional CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for higher returns.

Notably, Gevo’s acquisition of Red Trail Energy for $210 million,<sup>[13]</sup> a company with operational carbon capture, illustrates the market’s recognition of the potential value in CCUS projects.

5. **The Continued Growth of Renewables**  
Despite challenges, renewables remain a dominant force. Enverus Intelligence Research projects a 203% increase in total installed capacity in the lower 48 states by 2050, with renewable capacity growing from 31% to 63%.<sup>[14]</sup> However, the intermittency of renewables presents challenges for grid stability.

- California, a leader in renewables, has observed surplus generation during peak conditions, necessitating curtailment of solar supply.<sup>[15]</sup>  
- Texas is experiencing a different challenge, with electricity demand exceeding supply during peak hours, leading to rolling blackouts.<sup>[16]</sup>  

These contrasting dynamics underscore the need for grid modernization, increased investment in energy storage, and a shift towards dispatchable generation sources like natural gas and nuclear to ensure reliability as renewables penetrate further.

### Implications for MARA  

As a Bitcoin miner, MARA’s operations are energy-intensive, making it essential for the company to secure reliable and cost-effective power sources. Given the current trends in the energy sector, MARA should consider the following:

- **Partnerships with Power Producers**: Strategic alliances with gas-fired power plant operators in data center hubs can provide access to firm, 24/7 power at competitive rates, potentially leveraging excess capacity during off-peak hours. MARA could also explore joint ventures to develop behind-the-meter gas-fired generation to ensure energy security and mitigate price volatility.

- **Strategic Location of Mining Operations**: Markets like SPP, which ranks high in terms of robust forward power prices, low feedstock costs, and expected price volatility,<sup>[17]</sup> could be attractive locations for MARA’s mining farms.

### Executive Summary  

The Bitcoin mining landscape experienced significant shifts in the latter half of 2024. The April 2024 halving, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin price and hashprice, squeezing miners' profitability. However, the market demonstrated resilience, with Bitcoin price recovering to ~$67,275 and hashprice showing an uptrend, reaching a peak of ~$53.97 per PH/s/Day over a weekend in October.

This memo analyzes key market trends, including hashprice fluctuations, network hashrate dynamics, and the emergence of hashrate derivatives. It further delves into the strategic focus of industry leaders and outlines potential opportunities and implications for MARA.

### Hashprice Volatility & Network Hashrate Growth  

The post-halving period saw a challenging hashprice environment for Bitcoin miners. In September 2024, both USD and BTC-denominated monthly average hashprices hit a post-2017 low.

- Average USD hashprice fell by 2.7% month-over-month to $42.37 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  
- Average BTC hashprice fell by 2.8% month-over-month to 0.00070408 BTC per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>  

This decline was attributed to factors like the Bitcoin halving, macroeconomic uncertainty, and a surge in network hashrate fueled by next-generation ASICs. However, a late September price rebound in Bitcoin, coupled with a decrease in network difficulty and a slight uptick in transaction fees, contributed to a partial hashprice recovery, closing the month at $46.26 per PH/s/Day.<sup>1</sup>

Despite hashprice volatility, the network hashrate continued its upward trajectory, hitting an all-time high of 732 EH/s by October 21, 2024.<sup>2</sup> This growth underscores the industry's commitment to network security and long-term belief in Bitcoin's value proposition.

### The Rise of Hashrate Derivatives  

Luxor, a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, introduced innovative financing and risk management tools to the market. Luxor’s Deliverable Hashrate Forwards allow miners to sell future hashrate production for upfront capital. This mechanism provides miners with alternative financing options, reducing reliance on traditional debt financing or equity issuance.

Luxor also reported a thriving hashrate forward market, with private miners actively utilizing these instruments for hedging and financing. Notably, miners who hedged early in 2024 outperformed those who did not, demonstrating the effectiveness of hashrate derivatives in mitigating risk.<sup>1</sup>

### Focus and Shifts in Industry Leaders' Strategy  

Major Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Hut 8, Bitfarms, and CleanSpark have focused on strategic expansion and operational efficiency.

- Riot and Bitfarms reached a settlement, likely involving consolidation or collaboration, suggesting a move towards industry consolidation.<sup>3</sup>  
- Hut 8 expanded its partnership with BITMAIN, focusing on deploying next-generation miners to enhance operational efficiency.<sup>3</sup>  
- CleanSpark ended its colocation with Coinmint, aiming to cut operational costs and increase profitability.<sup>4</sup>  
- TeraWulf is actively seeking to expand its HPC/AI and Bitcoin mining operations.<sup>4</sup>  

MARA secured a $200 million credit line with Bitcoin collateral, signifying an increased focus on leveraging digital assets for financial flexibility.<sup>2</sup>

### Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Given the trends outlined above, MARA’s executive team should consider the following:

- **Hashrate Derivatives**: Explore the strategic use of hashrate derivatives to hedge against hashprice volatility and secure more predictable cash flows. Given Luxor's data on miners who hedged early outperforming spot miners, a hedging strategy could be critical to maintaining MARA's profitability in the volatile mining landscape.

- **Strategic Partnerships**: Consider forming strategic partnerships, similar to Hut 8's initiative, with ASIC manufacturers like BITMAIN to gain preferential access to next-generation miners. This would not only enhance MARA's operational efficiency but also potentially provide a competitive advantage in securing the latest hardware.

### Recent Focus and Strategic Shifts  

- **Shareholder Return**: CAT increased its quarterly dividend by 8% in June 2024 and expanded its share repurchase authorization by $20 billion, highlighting a commitment to returning free cash flow to shareholders.<sup>2</sup>  

- **Management Changes**: CAT appointed a new Group President of **Energy & Transportation (E&T)** in December 2023, potentially signaling a focus on realigning leadership within this segment.<sup>3</sup>  

- **Streamlined Board**: David L. Calhoun’s departure from the board in April 2024 suggests a move toward a smaller, more focused board for improved governance.<sup>4</sup>  

- **Credit Agreements**: CAT amended its credit agreements in August 2024, adding DBS Bank Ltd. as a lender and removing The Bank of New York Mellon, possibly for better terms or diversified funding sources.<sup>5, 6</sup>  

- **Executive Incentive Plans**: New 2023 incentive plans, including restricted stock unit (RSU) and non-qualified stock option (NQSO) awards, feature performance-based vesting, indicating a focus on aligning executive incentives with shareholder value.<sup>7, 8, 9</sup>

### Potential Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Caterpillar’s substantial free cash flow and commitment to shareholder return may influence institutional investment behavior in the broader equity market, impacting Bitcoin miners like MARA. Given CAT’s focus on sustainable energy solutions within its **E&T** segment, potential collaborations with MARA to integrate sustainable energy into Bitcoin mining operations could enhance MARA's ESG profile and attract ESG-focused investors.

Additionally, as CAT navigates macroeconomic shifts and commodity price fluctuations, MARA executives should monitor potential impacts on institutional investment in risk assets like Bitcoin. Any prolonged downturn in CAT’s core businesses, particularly RI and CI, could shift investment flows toward alternative investments. CAT’s increased emphasis on share buybacks and dividends could also impact Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative, providing opportunities for MARA to adjust capital allocation strategies accordingly.

### Recent Focus and Strategic Shifts  

1. **AI Cloud Expansion**: Soluna is heavily investing in AI cloud computing with projects like Project Grace (2 MW) and Project Ada (1 MW). Project Ada, utilizing HPE hardware, has seen rapid demand growth, building a waitlist of 672 GPUs. Project Grace, still in its concept design phase, reflects Soluna’s commitment to the AI boom.

2. **Bitcoin Hosting**: Existing projects—Dorothy 1A, 1B, Dorothy 2, and Sophie—are operating with a focus on fleet optimization. Soluna recently initiated an 8.8 MW upgrade and a 3.3 MW expansion at Project Sophie, while Dorothy 2's active construction shows continued investment in Bitcoin hosting.

3. **Capital Structure Simplification**: Soluna secured a $25 million SEPA with Yorkville Advisors in September 2024. This financing arrangement aims to reduce leverage by retiring existing convertible notes and funding AI cloud computing expansion. The SEPA includes flexible, 0% interest terms, providing Soluna with growth capital without complex financial instruments.

4. **Project Pipeline Development**: Soluna’s 2 GW project pipeline includes Project Kati (166 MW) and Project Rosa (187 MW), with recent milestones achieved for both. Project Kati is progressing with ERCOT approval for its Reactive Power Study, while Project Rosa has secured term sheets for power and land in Texas.

### Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

Soluna’s strategic expansion into AI cloud computing and focus on sustainable data centers offer insights and potential collaboration avenues for MARA. As ESG considerations gain prominence, MARA could leverage Soluna’s experience with modular green data centers to improve sustainability in mining practices. The MaestroOS software’s energy optimization capabilities may also be applicable in MARA’s operational strategy.

However, Soluna’s venture into AI computing signals rising competition. With growing demand for renewable energy, competition for ideal data center locations and power agreements will likely intensify. MARA should monitor Soluna’s progress, particularly at Project Kati and Project Rosa, and consider partnerships or acquisitions to maintain a competitive edge.

### Opportunities and Implications for MARA  

CAVA’s scalable, tech-driven model and positive free cash flow are instructive for MARA as it seeks to enhance operational efficiency and expand brand reach. Potential collaboration opportunities may involve MARA supporting CAVA's digital presence by offering Bitcoin payment options, increasing MARA's brand awareness. CAVA’s expansion and effective digital strategies provide valuable examples for MARA’s growth and engagement with retail investors.

Additionally, CAVA's success with scalable growth offers MARA insights into optimizing operations and leveraging economies of scale. As CAVA balances expansion and profitability, MARA may benefit from studying CAVA’s supply chain and tech platforms to streamline its own mining processes. Given CAVA’s positive free cash flow and growth trajectory, the company may also present an attractive investment opportunity for MARA’s portfolio diversification.
